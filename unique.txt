RULES OF THE GAME:

Egg catcher is a simple game where a chicken drops an egg, and your job as a baby chick is too catch the eggs.
You only have three lives, if you fail to catch it on your last life it's game over. As you collect more eggs
the drop speed increases to give a bit of a challenge.

FEATURES ADDED:

[Player Movement]
- Players can move with either the left and right arrow key, or A and D keys

- When the player gets close to the edge of the screen, instead of being able to run off, it will move the player back to the screen, this is to add a little bit of a boundary to it

[Sprites/Assets - scene changes]

- Created and modified the sprites needed for the units and images

- Added a start screen and a lose screen

- Before playing the game the user is shown the start screen, from there when they press the spacebar the player will be sent into the game screen

- When the player loses all its lives they will be sent to a lose screen. From there they have the option to try again by presssing spacebar.

[Gameplay]

- there is a Chicken on the top of the screen that moves left and right accross the screen.

- the chicken will randomly drop an egg

    - this is done by grabbing a random int value and rounding it to the nearest 10s digit - this is because the chicken moves in values of 10 and the egg follows the chicken

    - when the egg position matches the random int value, the egg would drop

- when the egg drops and overlaps with the player, the egg counter value would increase

    - when the value hits 5, the speed of the egg drop increases by 5. It keeps going like that and is capped at 25

- when the egg drops and overlaps with the ground, the life counter goes down by one, and the number of hearts seen on the bottom left of the screen decreases by one.

- once the # of hearts hit zero, the player will be on its last life - when this is the case the next egg that touches the ground will send the user into the lose screen

- when in the lose screen all the values get reseted ( drop speed, lives, eggs collected )

- the game will keep looping until the user closes out the game
